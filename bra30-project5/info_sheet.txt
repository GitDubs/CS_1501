Additional comments to the grader: I have used BigInteger functions in this program to supplement the math functions 
that I could not do myself. (GCD, Mod Inverse, and Exponentiation) I talked to Dr. Farnan about this and he said that
points would be deducted but that it was the best thing to do if I couldn't get some of the math functions working.
